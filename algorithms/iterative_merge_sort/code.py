# Iterative Merge Sort implementation
from merge.code import merge

"""
HOW TO RUN THIS FILE:

METHOD 1 (Recommended): Use module execution
From the 'algorithms' directory, run:
    python -m iterative_merge_sort.code

METHOD 2: Add sys.path fix for direct execution  
If you want to run directly with: python iterative_merge_sort/code.py
You need to add this BEFORE the import:
    import sys, os
    sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

WHY THE DIFFERENCE:
- Both files import from sibling directory: 'from merge.code import merge'
- Python's module resolution depends on the current working directory
- Module execution (-m) preserves the algorithms/ working directory
- Direct execution changes working directory to the script's location
- This affects where Python looks for the 'merge' module

if __name__ == "__main__": #  Thatâ€™s my execution guard. When I run this file directly with python iterative_merge_sort/code.py, the print(items) will execute; But when I import it from another file: from iterative_merge_sort.code import iterative_merge_sort. then __name__ != "__main__" so the test does not run 
    items = [38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10, 5]

    print(items)
